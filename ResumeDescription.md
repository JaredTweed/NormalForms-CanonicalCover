https://github.com/JaredTweed/NormalForms-CanonicalCover
* Developed a Python tool for analyzing functional dependencies in databases, including evaluation of closures, candidate keys, and canonical covers.
* Implemented features for assessing normalization (2NF, 3NF, BCNF) and verifying lossless, dependency-preserving decompositions in relational databases.
* Designed a user-centric interface for database schema analysis and educational purposes, optimized for back-end database management efficiency.
